Getting Started with Python

Introduction to Python

Python, a general-purpose programming language, has been around for quite a
while: Guido van Rossum, Python’s creator, started developing Python back in
1990. This stable and mature language is very high-level, dynamic, objectoriented,
and cross-platform—all very attractive characteristics. Python runs on
all major hardware platforms and operating systems, so it doesn’t constrain your
choices.
